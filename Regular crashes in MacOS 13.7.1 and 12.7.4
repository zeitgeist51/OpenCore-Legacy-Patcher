Hi all, I'm experiencing regular system crashes with macOS 13.7.1 on an iMac 11,1 (2,8 GHz intel Quad-Core (860) / 8GB RAM / AMD FirePro S7000X (mac flashed)/ 2TB internal SSD) 
with OCLP 2.1.2 incl. root patches. Monitor freezes and is unresponsive. After forced shutdown and reboot crash reports state mostly "windowServer" but "cpu panic" and 
"AutheticationServer" as well. Could it be a problem with the legacy CPU (no AEV2)? But then again, after sweeping the internal SSD and a clean istall of MacOs Monterey
(12.7.4) same problem with regular crashes occurs. Boot from external SSD with MacOS 10.13.6 works fine. Any help is truly appreciated!
